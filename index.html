						<p>  As New York City nurses sound the alarm on staffing shortages in their hospitals, their on-the-ground accounts are at times harrowing. But localized government data to track where and how those shortages are occurring is still slim.  </p>

						<p> Nurses from Mount Sinai and Montefiore medical centers have recently held demonstrations in Manhattan and the Bronx speaking out about staffing shortages and overcrowded hospital conditions. They described working 24-hour long shifts, overseeing more patients than they could safely handle, and experiencing long-term fatigue and burnout. </p>

						<p> But state data on where the staffing shortages are most acute is limited to licenses only. An analysis of registered professional nurse licensing data from the New York State Education Department – some of the only data available at a geographic level – shows Manhattan and the Bronx with the lowest per-capita number of nursing licenses per thousand residents in the city.   </p>

						<p> However, the licensing numbers don’t fully correlate to staffing shortages, according to Robert Martiniano, Senior Program Manager at the Albany-based Center for Health Workforce Studies.  He said the data does not include other factors like where the nurses practice, their hours, and how many are currently employed in their field.  </p> 

						<p> “We know that a lot of nurses travel between counties to go to work, so you may live in Queens or Brooklyn and work in Manhattan,” he said. “You may work out of the state, along the Pennsylvania, Vermont, and Massachusetts border, but come into New York State to work," he continued, noting that a high number of nurses commute from New Jersey, Westchester County, and Connecticut into Manhattan and the Bronx. </p>

						<p> Even then, he explained, the state’s data doesn’t show how many of those nurses are actually employed. U.S. census survey data estimates show that about two-thirds of nurses are currently working in their field, he said. The remainder are either retired and keeping their license or in administrative positions that don’t require a license. 
						</p> 

						<p> Federal <a href="https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes_35620.htm"> data </a> from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows an approximate ratio of 9 registered nurses employed per 1000 people in the New York-Newark-Jersey City metropolitan statistical area as of March 2020. That data covers 25 counties in New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania, and includes around 173,570 employed registred nurses in a population of approxmately 19.8 million residents. </p>

						<p> However, more localized details may become available in the future. State legislation currently awaiting the governor’s signature would require health professionals to provide information such as the location and type of setting in which they practice when applying for a license. That data would then be made publicly available. </p> 

						<p> "[The legislation] would solve a lot of the issues because we would be able to know the number of hours they work, where they're working, [or] if they're clinically active," Martiano said. </p> 

						<p> He said the legislation could give the public a better picture of the industry as a whole. </p> 

						<p> "It would allow us to understand the capacity of our workforce," he said.  </p>

					<div class="methodology"> 

						<i> <strong> METHODOLOGY:</strong> Mapped data was determined by dividing the number of registered professional nurse licenses per county by 2020 U.S. Census population estimates for each county, then multiplying the result by 1000 to determine nurses per thousand residents. Bureau of Labor Statistics data referenced in the story used the same formula but divided aggregate registered nurse employment data by the combined population for the following counties: <strong> New York: </strong> Bronx, Dutchess, Kings (Brooklyn), Nassau, New York (Manhattan), Orange, Putnam, Queens, Richmond (Staten Island), Rockland, Suffolk, Westchester; <strong> New Jersey: </strong> Bergen, Essex, Hudson, Hunterdon, Middlesex, Monmouth, Morris, Ocean, Passaic, Somerset, Sussex, Union; <strong> Pennsylvania: </strong> Pike. Quotient was then multiplied by 1000 and rounded to nearest whole number to determine approximate number of registerd nurses per thousand residents. </a> </i>
